# FAQ

### What's a fork?

In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a
copy of source code from one software package and start independent
development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software.

### Where are the waking up features like solve math problems, take pictures or anything like that to discard the alarm?

I believe alarm clocks are just tools, the responsible for waking you
up when you desire is yourself, every person is different but I can
suggest a way of dealing with this and it's called: personal
development.
