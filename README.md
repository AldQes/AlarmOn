# FAQ

### What's a fork?

In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a
copy of source code from one software package and start independent
development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software.

### Why does not implement waking up features like solve math problems to discard the alarm?

I believe alarm clocks are just tools, the responsible for waking you
up when you desire is yourself, PNL is a powerful medium that can
help you to achieve this goal in a powerful, fast and healthy way.
